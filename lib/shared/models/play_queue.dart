// lib/shared/models/play_queue.dart
// Data model for the audio playback queue.
//
// The queue holds an ordered list of audio files and tracks which file is
// currently being played.  It is built by the Browser module (BRW-04) when
// the user taps an audio file, and consumed by the Player module.
//
// PLY-05: 播放队列管理 — adds PlayMode support and queue-navigation logic
// (nextIndex / previousIndex) so the Player module can implement skip-to-next,
// skip-to-previous, and mode-aware queue wrapping.
