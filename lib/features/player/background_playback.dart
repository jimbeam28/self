// lib/features/player/background_playback.dart
// Background playback state model for PLY-03.
//
// Provides pure-logic enums and a state machine that models audio focus,
// background playback, and notification-control transitions.  These are
// fully testable without AudioPlayer or platform channels.
//
// The actual audio_service wiring (Android foreground service, iOS
// background modes) lives in lib/core/services/audio_handler.dart
// (PLY-04); this module defines the application-level state that
// gates those behaviours.

// ── Enums ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Audio focus states as defined by the system audio manager.
///
///   - [gained]: the app has audio focus (normal playback).
///   - [lost]: another app has taken focus permanently — playback should stop.
///   - [transient]: another app has taken focus temporarily (e.g. a
///     notification sound) — playback may duck but should resume afterwards.
enum AudioFocusState { gained, lost, transient }

/// Background playback states of the player.
///
///   - [playing]: audio is actively playing (foreground or background).
///   - [paused]:  audio is paused but the player session is still alive,
///     so it can be resumed from a notification or lock-screen control.
///   - [stopped]: the player session has been torn down; a new [play]
///     must be issued to restart.
enum BackgroundPlaybackState { playing, paused, stopped }

/// The user-facing playback action from notification / lock-screen controls.
///
/// These are the actions that external UI (notification, lock screen,
/// headset buttons) can trigger on the background player.
enum MediaControlAction { play, pause, stop, togglePlayPause }

// ── State machine ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Immutable value object that captures the state of background audio playback.
///
/// The state transitions are driven by two orthogonal inputs:
///   1. **App lifecycle** — when the app moves between foreground and
///      background, [isInForeground] changes but audio continues.
///   2. **Media controls** — pause / play actions from notification or
///      lock-screen controls.
///
/// The invariants are:
///   - Audio continues playing when the app transitions to background
///     as long as [backgroundEnabled] is true.
///   - Pausing from a notification sets [playbackState] to [paused]
///     but does not tear down the background session.
///   - Lock-screen state (a system concern) does not interrupt playback.
